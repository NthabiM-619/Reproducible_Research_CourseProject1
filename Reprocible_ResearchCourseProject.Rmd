```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
##Loading and preprocessing the data
#1.Load the data
if(!file.exists("getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip")){
  temp <- tempfile()
  download.file("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2Factivity.zip",temp)
  unzip(temp)
  unlink(temp)
}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
head(activity)
```


#What is the mean number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
totalStepsByDay <- aggregate(steps~date, activity, sum)
```

##Step 2
#Histogram of the total Number of Steps taken each day
``{r, echo = TRUE}
hist(totalStepsByDay$steps, xlab="Class of Total Number of Steps per day", ylab="Number of Days", main="Total Number of Steps taken each day")
```

##Step 3
##Calculate and report the Mean and Median Number of the Steps taken each day

```{r, echo = TRUE}
mean_raw <- mean(totalStepsByDay$steps)
mean_raw
#Mean number of steps taken per day is 1.076618910^{4}

median_raw <- median(totalStepsByDay$steps)
median_raw
#Median number of steps taken per day is 10765
```

#What is the Average daily activity pattern?

##Step 4
##The Average Number of steps taken
```{r, echo = TRUE}
averageStepbyInterval <- aggregate(steps~interval, activity, mean)

##Time series Plot of the Average Number of Steps taken
with(averageStepbyInterval, plot(interval, steps, type = "l"))
```


##Step 5
##The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum Number of Steps.

```{r, echo = TRUE}
averageStepbyInterval[which.max(averageStepbyInterval[,2]), 1]
```


##Step 6
## Imputing missing values
##Calculate and report the Total Number of missing values in the dataset(i.e.the total number of rows with NAs)
```{r, echo = TRUE}
missingIndex <- is.na(activity[, 1])
# There are 2304 missing values in the dataset.

#finding the mean Number of Steps per Interval
m <-  mean(averageStepbyInterval$steps)
```

##Step 7

```{r, echo = TRUE}

#Imputing missing values with m 
activity1 <- activity
activity1[missingIndex, 1] <- m
head(activity1)

#Histogram of the Total Number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed.
totalStepsByDay1 <- aggregate(steps~date, activity1, sum)
hist(totalStepsByDay1$steps, xlab = "Class of Total Number of Steps per day", ylab = "Number of Days", main = "Number of Steps taken each day after missing values are imputed")
```

```{r, echo = TRUE}
#Calculate the mean and median total number of steps per day, firstly, we get the total number of steps per day

totalStepsByDay1 <- aggregate(steps~date, activity1, sum)
mean_afterImput <- mean(totalStepsByDay1$steps)
mean_afterImput

#Mean Number of steps taken per day is 1.076618910^{4}

median_afterImput <- median(totalStepsByDay1$steps)
median_afterImput

#Median Number of steps taken per day is 1.076618910^{4}

#There is no difference in mean before and after imputing the value.The median has changed a little.
```


##Step 8
##Creating a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels "weekday" and "weekend" which will indicate whether a given date is a weekday or weekend
```{r, echo = TRUE}
activity1$date <- as.Date(activity1$date)
library(dplyr)
activity2 <- activity1%>%
    mutate(dayType = ifelse(weekdays(activity1$date)=="Saturday" | weekdays(activity1$date)=="Sunday", "Weekend", "Weekday"))
    head(activity2)
 ``` 
    
#Panel plot comparing thea average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
```{r, echo = TRUE}
averageStepByDayTypeAndInterval <- activity2%>%
group_by(dayType, interval) %>%
summarize(averageStepByDay = sum(steps))
head(averageStepByDayTypeAndInterval)

library(lattice)
with(averageStepByDayDayTypeAndInterval,
xyplot(averageStepByDayTypeAndInterval ~ interval | dayType,
type = "l",
main = "Total Number of steps within Intervals by dayType",
xlab = "Daily Intervals",
ylab = "Average Number of steps"))
```    



```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
